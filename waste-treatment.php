                                Compact, efficient, low cost clarifier combines technologies and advantages of solids contact clarifier and lamella clarifier, with enhanced performance at increased rise rate.

                                Combines mixing, reaction-flocculation, clarification, and sedimentation/sludge removal and recirculation in a single treatment basin for maximum treated water production in minimal space. Handles high inlet suspended solids load up to 3000 ppm while giving consistent treated water quality of <20 ppm.

                                High performance clarifier incorporates design of internal solid recirculation, optimising chemical consumption and making it more economical than conventional clarifiers. Works on principles of coagulation/flocculation and hydraulic separation to produce clarified water of the highest quality; flash mixer, flocculation and thickener mechanism are inbuilt. They reduce chemical requirement, save space and are easy to operate.

                                Series of inclined plates (lamellae) achieve effective solid-liquid separation. Large settling surfaces concentrated within relatively small floor area, so for same liquid flow, occupies 1/10th footprint of conventional clarifier. Laminar, stable flow and excellent effluent quality; modular design, no moving paths, removable plates can be lifted easily and cleaned with operation shutdowns.
